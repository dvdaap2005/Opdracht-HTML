    <h1>Hawkeye</h1>
    <p>Hawkeye, the legendary marksman of the Avengers, takes on a crucial role in Marvel Rivals.<br>
     Armed with his signature bow and an array of high-tech trick arrows, he excels in long-range combat, picking off enemies with pinpoint precision.</p>
    <p>In the game, Hawkeye is part of the "Allied Agents" team-up with Black Widow.<br>
     His special ability, Hunter's Sight, enhances Black Widow’s vision, allowing her to track enemy afterimages and deal extra damage.<br> 
     This synergy makes them a deadly duo in tactical engagements.</p>
    <p>With his agility, sharpshooting skills, and strategic utility, Hawkeye is a valuable asset on the battlefield, perfect for players who prefer precision over brute force.<br>
    Whether supporting teammates or taking down foes from a distance, he proves that you don’t need superpowers to be a superhero.</p>
